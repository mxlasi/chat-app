Hello!

I'm Laura Sillanpää, Interactive Media 1st year

I'm interested in comics, cats, Beat Saber and time

All my experience in web dev has been gained in courses during this and last semester

I've grown up to be an eternal student who sometimes gets paid for drawing things
but I'm trying to figure out how to get paid for doing this computer stuff instead
